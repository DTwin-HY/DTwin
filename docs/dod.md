# Definition of Done

This document describes the Definition of Done of this project for each of its sprints (translated from Finnish).

## Sprint 1
* The code is clean.
* The code is commented in a way that makes its logic clear to others.
* Features have tests.

## Sprint 2
* The quality of the code is high and has been refactored.
* The code is thoroughly tested.

## Final Definition of Done
* The previous requirements.
* Testing can be ignored for some features, if the code has more to do with LangGraph than business logic, and the entire team agrees.
